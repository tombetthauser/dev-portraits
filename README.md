# Developer Portraits

Random portraits of computer people. Mainly coworkers, friends, family, some computer history randos and my two year old who I assume will be a jaded developer eventually.

## If you want a portrait...

If you want your portrait drawn, buy a computer buddy! More information on that below. These will also be made available periodically in free-to-download zines that will be linked on this repo and in person at exhibitions occasionally.
